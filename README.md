# 💘 LoveMatch: A Fun Compatibility Predictor

LoveMatch is a fun and interactive Python project that predicts the "love compatibility" between two people based on their names. It uses a simple, rule-based method to generate a love score and match message, making it a light-hearted and engaging app for friends, couples, and curious users.

## 🚀 Features

* 💡 Takes two names as input and computes a love score
* 💬 Displays a compatibility percentage and a custom love message
* 🎨 User-friendly interface using Streamlit (if deployed)
* 🤗 Purely for entertainment purposes — no real-world implications!

## 🧠 How It Works

The love score is randomly generated using `random.randint()` and is combined with conditional statements to assign a custom love message. It’s designed to be unpredictable and fun.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
LoveMatch.ipynb        # Jupyter Notebook with complete source code
```

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
* Libraries:

  * `random`
  * `streamlit` (if deploying as a web app)

Install Streamlit (optional):

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

## ▶️ How to Run

### 🧪 Jupyter Notebook

1. Open `LoveMatch.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all the cells.
3. Enter names and view the love match result!

### 🌐 Optional: Run with Streamlit

If you want a simple web interface:

```bash
streamlit run LoveMatch.py
```

(You’ll need to convert the notebook into a Python script first)

## 🎯 Sample Output

```
Enter your name: Alice 
Enter your partner's name: Bob

💘 Love score: 86%

💬 Your connection is magical! True love is in the air!
```

## 📌 Disclaimer

This project is just for fun and not based on real science. Use it light-heartedly and enjoy the results!
